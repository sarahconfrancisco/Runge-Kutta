# Runge-Kutta
## About
This is a simple implementation of the 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method. Runge-Kutta is used to approximate the solution 
of ordinary differential equations. Currently this module only solves with the 4th Order Runge-Kutta method but I want 
to expand the module to solve with whatever order Runge-Kutta the user specifies. 
## To Use:
1. download
2. run <tt>python runge_kutta.py</tt>
